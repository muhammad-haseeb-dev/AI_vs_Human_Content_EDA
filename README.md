# AI vs Human Content EDA

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of text samples generated by humans, AI models, and post-edited AI. The analysis explores patterns in content type, domain, language, word counts, and prompt usage.

## Dataset Overview
- **Rows:** 686
- **Columns:** 11
  - `id` – Unique identifier for each text entry
  - `text` – Actual text content
  - `human_or_ai` – Indicates if content is human-written, AI-generated, or post-edited AI
  - `source_model` – The AI model or "Human" that created the content
  - `prompt` – Input prompt used for generating content (if AI)
  - `domain` – Content category (e.g., News, Education, Email)
  - `language` – Language of the text
  - `edit_level` – Any edits made to the content
  - `word_count` – Number of words in the text
  - `generation_date` – Date of content creation
  - `version` – Dataset version

## Key Insights from EDA
- Total samples by author type (`human_or_ai`)
- Average word count by content type and domain
- Distribution of content across languages and domains
- Most frequent prompts used for AI-generated content
- Comparison of human-written vs AI-written content

## Visualizations
- Bar plots for content distribution by `human_or_ai` and `domain`
- Average word count trends across content types
- Language distribution across human and AI texts

## Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `AI_vs_Human_Content_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run the cells to see EDA tables, counts, and visualizations
